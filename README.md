Structure of the IoT Platform for Logistics and Scheduling
The proposed IoT platform for logistics and scheduling utilizes a microservices architecture, leveraging Docker for containerization. 
This ensures scalable, portable, and isolated service deployment. 
The platform integrates two key communication paradigms: publish/subscribe (via MQTT) and request/response (via REST).

  System Components
1.Device Connectors for Vehicles

  Communication:
REST endpoints for seamless communication.
MQTT for continuous vehicle updates.
  Implementation:
Deployed on Raspberry Pi hardware, simulated for scalability.
Dockerized for consistent deployment.

2.Device Connectors for Logistics Points

Function:
Link between logistics points (warehouses, delivery points, users) and the platform.
Control actions like locking/unlocking doors and provide warehouse visibility.
Deployment:
Docker containers for easy scaling and management.

3.User Web App

Features:
Track vehicle status, control delivery points, and view an analytical map.
Deployment:
Dockerized web application for consistent user experience across environments.

4.Catalog

Role:
Centralized store for logistics entities.
Functionality:
Manages comprehensive data (identifiers, user info, package details, vehicle data).
API:
CRUD REST API for secure data management.
Deployment:
Containerized for scalability and portability.

5.Persistent Storage and Databases

Function:
Centralized data repository.
Integration:
Connected to the Catalog via REST, storing data in JSON format.
Deployment:
Dockerized database instances for consistency and ease of maintenance.

6.Message Broker

Role:
Hub for asynchronous data exchange.
Protocol:
Operates over MQTT.
Deployment:
Docker container for the message broker to handle real-time communication.

7.Data Analytics
Driver Reputation System

Function:
Evaluates driver performance (punctuality, handling, feedback).
Operation:
Uses MQTT updates for real-time scoring.
Deployment:
Containerized service for efficient processing and evaluation.

8.Warehouse Reputation System

Function:
Assesses warehouse efficiency (inventory accuracy, order times, error rates).
Operation:
Uses REST for data aggregation and scoring.
Deployment:
Dockerized for easy integration and scaling.
Additional Components

9.Telegram Bot

Role:
Provides real-time delivery status notifications.
Function:
Retrieves info from the Catalog via MQTT and displays results via REST.
Integration:
Operates within Telegram for user convenience.
Deployment:
Dockerized to ensure consistent performance.

10.Timeseries DB Connector

Tool:
Telegraf for collecting and reporting metrics.
Function:
Ingests data from various sources and sends it to InfluxDB.
Frameworks:
Utilizes CherryPy and Flask.
Deployment:
Containerized for consistent metric collection and reporting.
Docker Integration
Each microservice is packaged into a Docker container.
Docker Compose is used for orchestrating multi-container applications.
Ensures portability, scalability, and isolation of services.
Simplifies deployment and management across different environments.
This structure ensures a robust, scalable, and efficient IoT platform for logistics and scheduling, leveraging Docker for containerization to enhance deployment and management.
